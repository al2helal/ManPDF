Archive::Zip::FAQ - Answers to a few frequently asked questions about
  Archive::Zip
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="selflink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
It seems that I keep answering the same questions over and over again. I assume
  that this is because my documentation is deficient, rather than that people
  don't read the documentation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
So this FAQ is an attempt to cut down on the number of personal answers I have
  to give. At least I can now say &quot;You <i>did</i> read the FAQ,
  right?&quot;.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The questions are not in any particular order. The answers assume the current
  version of Archive::Zip; some of the answers depend on newly added/fixed
  functionality.

  problems on RedHat 8 or 9 with Perl 5.8.0</a></h1>
<b>Q:</b> Archive::Zip won't install on my RedHat 9 system! It's broke!
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>A:</b> This has become something of a FAQ. Basically, RedHat broke some
  versions of Perl by setting LANG to UTF8. They apparently have a fixed version
  out as an update.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You might try running CPAN or creating your Makefile after exporting the LANG
  environment variable as

&quot;LANG=C&quot;

  <dd class="It-tag">Since zip computes the compression tables for each member,
      small members without much entropy won't compress well. Instead, if you've

  Read/modify/write same Zip file</a></h1>
<b>Q:</b> Why can't I open a Zip file, add a member, and write it back? I get an
  error message when I try.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>A:</b> Because Archive::Zip doesn't (and can't, generally) read file contents
  into memory, the original Zip file is required to stay around until the
  writing of the new file is completed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The best way to do this is to write the Zip to a temporary file and then rename
  the temporary file to have the old name (possibly after deleting the old one).
<div class="Pp"></div>
Archive::Zip v1.02 added the archive methods &quot;overwrite()&quot; and
  &quot;overwriteAs()&quot; to do this simply and carefully.
<div class="Pp"></div>
See &quot;examples/updateZip.pl&quot; for an example of this technique.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="File_creation_time_not_set"><a class="selflink" href="#File_creation_time_not_set">File
  creation time not set</a></h1>
<b>Q:</b> Upon extracting files, I see that their modification (and access)
  times are set to the time in the Zip archive. However, their creation time is
  not set to the same time. Why?
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>A:</b> Mostly because Perl doesn't give cross-platform access to <i>creation
  time</i>. Indeed, many systems (like Unix) don't support such a concept.
  However, if yours does, you can easily set it. Get the modification time from
  the member using &quot;lastModTime()&quot;.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Can't_use_Archive::Zip_on_gzip_files"><a class="selflink" href="#Can't_use_Archive::Zip_on_gzip_files">Can't
  use Archive::Zip on gzip files</a></h1>
<b>Q:</b> Can I use Archive::Zip to extract Unix gzip files?
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>A:</b> No.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is a distinction between Unix gzip files, and Zip archives that also can
  use the gzip compression.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Depending on the format of the gzip file, you can use Compress::Raw::Zlib, or
  Archive::Tar to decompress it (and de-archive it in the case of Tar files).
<div class="Pp"></div>
You can unzip PKZIP/WinZip/etc/ archives using Archive::Zip (that's what it's
  for) as long as any compressed members are compressed using Deflate
  compression.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Add_a_directory/tree_to_a_Zip"><a class="selflink" href="#Add_a_directory/tree_to_a_Zip">Add
  a directory/tree to a Zip</a></h1>
<b>Q:</b> How can I add a directory (or tree) full of files to a Zip?
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>A:</b> You can use the Archive::Zip::addTree*() methods:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   use Archive::Zip;
   my $zip = Archive::Zip-&gt;new();
   # add all readable files and directories below . as xyz/*
   $zip-&gt;addTree( '.', 'xyz' ); 
   # add all readable plain files below /abc as def/*
   $zip-&gt;addTree( '/abc', 'def', sub { -f &amp;&amp; -r } );    
   # add all .c files below /tmp as stuff/*
   $zip-&gt;addTreeMatching( '/tmp', 'stuff', '\.c$' );
   # add all .o files below /tmp as stuff/* if they aren't writable
   $zip-&gt;addTreeMatching( '/tmp', 'stuff', '\.o$', sub { ! -w } );
   # add all .so files below /tmp that are smaller than 200 bytes as stuff/*
   $zip-&gt;addTreeMatching( '/tmp', 'stuff', '\.o$', sub { -s &lt; 200 } );
   # and write them into a file
   $zip-&gt;writeToFileNamed('xxx.zip');
</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Extract_a_directory/tree"><a class="selflink" href="#Extract_a_directory/tree">Extract
  a directory/tree</a></h1>
<b>Q:</b> How can I extract some (or all) files from a Zip into a different
  directory?
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>A:</b> You can use the <i>Archive::Zip::extractTree()</i> method: ??? ||
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
   # now extract the same files into /tmpx
   $zip-&gt;extractTree( 'stuff', '/tmpx' );
</pre>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Update_a_directory/tree"><a class="selflink" href="#Update_a_directory/tree">Update
  a directory/tree</a></h1>
<b>Q:</b> How can I update a Zip from a directory tree, adding or replacing only
  the newer files?
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>A:</b> You can use the <i>Archive::Zip::updateTree()</i> method that was
  added in version 1.09.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Zip_times_might_be_off_by_1_second"><a class="selflink" href="#Zip_times_might_be_off_by_1_second">Zip
  times might be off by 1 second</a></h1>
<b>Q:</b> It bothers me greatly that my file times are wrong by one second about
  half the time. Why don't you do something about it?
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>A:</b> Get over it. This is a result of the Zip format storing times in DOS
  format, which has a resolution of only two seconds.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Zip_times_don't_include_time_zone_information"><a class="selflink" href="#Zip_times_don't_include_time_zone_information">Zip
  times don't include time zone information</a></h1>
<b>Q:</b> My file times don't respect time zones. What gives?
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>A:</b> If this is important to you, please submit patches to read the various
  Extra Fields that encode times with time zones. I'm just using the DOS
  Date/Time, which doesn't have a time zone.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="How_do_I_make_a_self-extracting_Zip"><a class="selflink" href="#How_do_I_make_a_self-extracting_Zip">How
  do I make a self-extracting Zip</a></h1>
<b>Q:</b> I want to make a self-extracting Zip file. Can I do this?
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>A:</b> Yes. You can write a self-extracting archive stub (that is, a version
  of unzip) to the output filehandle that you pass to
  <i>writeToFileHandle()</i>. See examples/selfex.pl for how to write a
  self-extracting archive.
<div class="Pp"></div>
However, you should understand that this will only work on one kind of platform
  (the one for which the stub was compiled).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="How_can_I_deal_with_Zips_with_prepended_garbage_(i.e._from_Sircam)"><a class="selflink" href="#How_can_I_deal_with_Zips_with_prepended_garbage_(i.e._from_Sircam)">How
  can I deal with Zips with prepended garbage (i.e. from Sircam)</a></h1>
<b>Q:</b> How can I tell if a Zip has been damaged by adding garbage to the
  beginning or inside the file?
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>A:</b> I added code for this for the Amavis virus scanner. You can query
  archives for their 'eocdOffset' property, which should be 0:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  if ($zip-&gt;eocdOffset &gt; 0)
    { warn($zip-&gt;eocdOffset . &quot; bytes of garbage at beginning or within Zip&quot;) }
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
When members are extracted, this offset will be used to adjust the start of the
  member if necessary.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Can't_extract_Shrunk_files"><a class="selflink" href="#Can't_extract_Shrunk_files">Can't
  extract Shrunk files</a></h1>
<b>Q:</b> I'm trying to extract a file out of a Zip produced by PKZIP, and keep
  getting this error message:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  error: Unsupported compression combination: read 6, write 0
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>A:</b> You can't uncompress this archive member. Archive::Zip only supports
  uncompressed members, and compressed members that are compressed using the
  compression supported by Compress::Raw::Zlib. That means only Deflated and
  Stored members.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Your file is compressed using the Shrink format, which isn't supported by
  Compress::Raw::Zlib.
<div class="Pp"></div>
You could, perhaps, use a command-line UnZip program (like the Info-Zip one) to
  extract this.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Can't_do_decryption"><a class="selflink" href="#Can't_do_decryption">Can't
  do decryption</a></h1>
<b>Q:</b> How do I decrypt encrypted Zip members?
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>A:</b> With some other program or library. Archive::Zip doesn't support
  decryption, and probably never will (unless <i>you</i> write it).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="How_to_test_file_integrity?"><a class="selflink" href="#How_to_test_file_integrity?">How
  to test file integrity?</a></h1>
<b>Q:</b> How can Archive::Zip can test the validity of a Zip file?
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>A:</b> If you try to decompress the file, the gzip streams will report errors
  if you have garbage. Most of the time.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If you try to open the file and a central directory structure can't be found, an
  error will be reported.
<div class="Pp"></div>
When a file is being read, if we can't find a proper PK.. signature in the right
  places we report a format error.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If there is added garbage at the beginning of a Zip file (as inserted by some
  viruses), you can find out about it, but Archive::Zip will ignore it, and you
  can still use the archive. When it gets written back out the added stuff will
  be gone.
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are two ready-to-use utilities in the examples directory that can be used
  to test file integrity, or that you can use as examples for your own code:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt class="It-tag">examples/zipcheck.pl shows how to use an attempted
    extraction to test a file.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>

  <dt class="It-tag">examples/ziptest.pl shows how to test CRCs in a file.</dt>
  <dd class="It-tag"></dd>

<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Duplicate_files_in_Zip?"><a class="selflink" href="#Duplicate_files_in_Zip?">Duplicate
  files in Zip?</a></h1>
<b>Q:</b> Archive::Zip let me put the same file in my Zip twice! Why don't you
  prevent this?
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>A:</b> As far as I can tell, this is not disallowed by the Zip spec. If you
  think it's a bad idea, check for it yourself:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<pre>
  $zip-&gt;addFile($someFile, $someName) unless $zip-&gt;memberNamed($someName);
</pre>
<div class="Pp"></div>
I can even imagine cases where this might be useful (for instance, multiple
  versions of files).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="File_ownership/permissions/ACLS/etc"><a class="selflink" href="#File_ownership/permissions/ACLS/etc">File
  ownership/permissions/ACLS/etc</a></h1>
<b>Q:</b> Why doesn't Archive::Zip deal with file ownership, ACLs, etc.?
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>A:</b> There is no standard way to represent these in the Zip file format. If
  you want to send me code to properly handle the various extra fields that have
  been used to represent these through the years, I'll look at it.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="I_can't_compile_but_ActiveState_only_has_an_old_version_of_Archive::Zip"><a class="selflink" href="#I_can't_compile_but_ActiveState_only_has_an_old_version_of_Archive::Zip">I
  can't compile but ActiveState only has an old version of Archive::Zip</a></h1>
<b>Q:</b> I've only installed modules using ActiveState's PPM program and
  repository. But they have a much older version of Archive::Zip than is in
  CPAN. Will you send me a newer PPM?
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>A:</b> Probably not, unless I get lots of extra time. But there's no reason
  you can't install the version from CPAN. Archive::Zip is pure Perl, so all you
  need is NMAKE, which you can get for free from Microsoft (see the FAQ in the
  ActiveState documentation for details on how to install CPAN modules).
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="My_JPEGs_(or_MP3's)_don't_compress_when_I_put_them_into_Zips!"><a class="selflink" href="#My_JPEGs_(or_MP3's)_don't_compress_when_I_put_them_into_Zips!">My
  JPEGs (or MP3's) don't compress when I put them into Zips!</a></h1>
<b>Q:</b> How come my JPEGs and MP3's don't compress much when I put them into
  Zips?
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>A:</b> Because they're already compressed.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Under_Windows,_things_lock_up/get_damaged"><a class="selflink" href="#Under_Windows,_things_lock_up/get_damaged">Under
  Windows, things lock up/get damaged</a></h1>
<b>Q:</b> I'm using Windows. When I try to use Archive::Zip, my machine locks
  up/makes funny sounds/displays a BSOD/corrupts data. How can I fix this?
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>A:</b> First, try the newest version of Compress::Raw::Zlib. I know of
  Windows-related problems prior to v1.14 of that library.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If that doesn't get rid of the problem, fix your computer or get rid of Windows.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Zip_contents_in_a_scalar"><a class="selflink" href="#Zip_contents_in_a_scalar">Zip
  contents in a scalar</a></h1>
<b>Q:</b> I want to read a Zip file from (or write one to) a scalar variable
  instead of a file. How can I do this?
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>A:</b> Use &quot;IO::String&quot; and the &quot;readFromFileHandle()&quot;
  and &quot;writeToFileHandle()&quot; methods. See
  &quot;examples/readScalar.pl&quot; and &quot;examples/writeScalar.pl&quot;.
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="Reading_from_streams"><a class="selflink" href="#Reading_from_streams">Reading

<b>Q:</b> How do I read from a stream (like for the Info-Zip &quot;funzip&quot;
  program)?
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>A:</b>	This isn't currently supported, though writing to a stream is.</div>
